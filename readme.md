# Linux/Git Command Cheat Sheet

This repo is an introductory assignment and exercise in branching and merging. It will contain only this readme, consisting of at least 15 Git or Linux shell commands and their functions, each committed on their own branch.

### Linux Commands

* cd [dir] -- *change directory*: moves the shell frame into a directory at [dir] \(ex. *cd workspace* moves into a directory called workspace inside the working directory\)
* mkdir [path] -- *make directory*: creates a new directory at ./[path]
